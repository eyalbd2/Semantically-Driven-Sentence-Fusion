## Augmented Data Generation for RAML Algorithm

Codes here are mainly copied from [pcyin's github](https://github.com/pcyin/pytorch_nmt), with slightly change for supporting ```rouge``` as reward. Note that we have also provided generated samples in the datasets that you can download.

You may tune hyperparameters in ```gen_samples_giga.sh```  or  ```gen_samples_iwslt14.sh``` and use commands like ```bash gen_samples_giga.sh``` to begin your generation.
